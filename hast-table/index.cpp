/**
 * A Hash Table (also known as a Hash Map) is a data structure that stores data in key-value pairs.
It allows you to insert, search, and delete data very quickly â€” usually in O(1) average time.



ðŸ§© Applications of Hash Table

âœ… Database indexing
âœ… Caching (e.g., browser cache, memory cache)
âœ… Compiler symbol tables
âœ… Password storage (with hashing)
âœ… Implementing maps and sets
