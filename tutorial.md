ðŸŽ¬ Tutorial Script: Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms

[Intro]
Hello everyone! 
Today, we are going to talk about Data Structures and Algorithms, which is one of the most fundamental and important topics in computer science.

So, letâ€™s start with the first question: 

* What is a Data Structure?

    A data structure is a way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that we can use it efficiently.

    Think about it like this: 
    If you want to store your clothes, you need a wardrobe.
    If you want to store your books, you need a bookshelf.

    In the same way, if we want to store data in a computer, we use different types of data structures.


    Some common examples are:
    - Arrays
    - Linked Lists
    - Stacks
    - Queues
    - Trees
    - Graphs

    Each of these structures has its own advantages and disadvantages.


Now letâ€™s move to the second question: What is an Algorithm?

An algorithm is just a step-by-step set of instructions to solve a problem.

For example, if you want to make a cup of tea, you follow certain steps:

    - Boil the water
    - Add tea leaves
    - Add sugar and milk
    - Finally, serve it in a cup
    - 
    This is an algorithm in real life.

In computer science, algorithms are written in a way that a computer can understand and execute them.
